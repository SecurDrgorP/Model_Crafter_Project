## Project Overview
This project aims to:
1. **Detect Diseases**: Classify fruits/vegetables as healthy or diseased (e.g., `Apple_Healthy` vs. `Apple_Rotten`).
2. **Compare Models**: Evaluate CNN performance against traditional ML models (SVM, KNN, Random Forest).

**Key Features**:
- Data splitting into train/val/test sets.
- CNN model with TensorFlow/Keras.
- Traditional ML pipelines with scikit-learn.
- Model accuracy comparison and visualization.
